gpt-4:
    "Playing back" generally refers to the process of reproducing a previously recorded audio or video material. 
    This term is commonly used in the context of media players, music, movies, and other types of recorded content. 
    When you play back a recording, you are essentially listening to or watching the content that was captured earlier. 
    For example, when you listen to a song on your music player or watch a video on your computer, you are playing back the recorded material.

就是 "回放" 的意思, 因为播放的这些信息是早前录制的;
中文里还是叫 "播放" 比较没有歧义...

#   区别: constraint , restrict
# ----------------------- #

"Constraint" refers to something that limits or restricts someone or something. It can be a physical limitation or a limitation imposed by rules or regulations. For example, a lack of resources can be a constraint on a project's success, or a legal constraint can limit a person's actions.

"Restrict" refers to the act of limiting or controlling something or someone. It is an action taken to impose a limitation. For example, a company may restrict access to certain websites on its employees' computers, or a diet may restrict the intake of certain types of food.

So, while both words imply limitations, "constraint" is more of a noun that describes a limiting factor, while "restrict" is more of a verb that describes the action taken to limit or control something.

# 最大区别: 
    Constraint  是名词
    restrict    是动词

#   区别: status , state
# ----------------------- #

gpt-3.5:

"Status" and "state" are two different terms with distinct meanings.

"Status" typically refers to the current condition or situation of something. In the context of software development and version control systems like Git, the "git status" command is used to display the current state of the working directory and staging area, showing which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

"State," on the other hand, generally refers to the overall condition or mode of something at a particular point in time. 
In the context of software or systems, "state" can refer to the current configuration, settings, or data of a program or a system. 
In the context of version control, "state" could refer to the overall condition of the repository, including the state of various branches, commits, and files.

In summary, 
"status" typically refers to the current condition of specific elements, 
"state" refers to the overall condition or configuration of a system or entity.

#   区别: catch , capture
# ----------------------- #

The main difference between "catch" and "capture" is that "catch" refers to the act of grabbing or seizing something that is moving or in motion, while "capture" refers to the act of catching or seizing something that is not necessarily in motion, such as an idea or a moment. "Catch" is often used in the context of physical objects or living beings, while "capture" is often used in the context of abstract concepts or intangible things. Additionally, "catch" can also mean to intercept or stop something from falling or escaping, while "capture" does not have this connotation.

# catch 适合表达 "捉住活物"
# capture 可以表达 "捉住想法"

#   区别: period , duration
# ----------------------- #

"Period" 和 "duration" 都与时间有关，但它们在使用上有一些区别：

Period（周期）：

    通常指一个重复事件的时间间隔。例如，地球绕太阳一周的时间是一个周期。
    可以表示一个特定的时间段，通常是指某个事件或现象的开始和结束之间的时间。例如，"冰河时期"。

Duration（持续时间）：

    指某个事件或活动从开始到结束所持续的时间长度。它强调的是时间的长度，而不是重复性。
    例如，一场电影的持续时间是两个小时。
    简单来说，"period" 更强调时间的循环性或特定的时间段，而 "duration" 更关注时间的长度或持续性。

#   区别: fluid, liquid
# ----------------------- #

定义：
Fluid：这个词是一个广泛的术语，指的是任何能够流动的物质，包括液体、气体和某些非牛顿流体。流体的主要特征是它们没有固定的形状，能够适应其容器的形状。
Liquid：这个词特指一种流体状态，通常指在常温和常压下具有固定体积但没有固定形状的物质。液体是流体的一种，但不是所有流体都是液体。

状态：
Fluid：包括液体和气体。例如，空气（气体）也是一种流体。
Liquid：仅限于液体状态，如水、油、酒等。

物理特性：
Fluid：可以是可压缩的（如气体）或不可压缩的（如液体）。
Liquid：通常被视为不可压缩的，尽管在极端条件下也可能表现出可压缩性。

应用：
Fluid：在科学和工程中，流体力学研究流体的行为，包括液体和气体。
Liquid：在日常生活中，液体通常指的是我们可以直接观察和使用的液体物质。


# 似乎 fluid 更宽泛些;
