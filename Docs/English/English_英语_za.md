gpt-4:
    "Playing back" generally refers to the process of reproducing a previously recorded audio or video material. 
    This term is commonly used in the context of media players, music, movies, and other types of recorded content. 
    When you play back a recording, you are essentially listening to or watching the content that was captured earlier. 
    For example, when you listen to a song on your music player or watch a video on your computer, you are playing back the recorded material.

就是 "回放" 的意思, 因为播放的这些信息是早前录制的;
中文里还是叫 "播放" 比较没有歧义...

#   区别: constraint , restrict
# ----------------------- #

"Constraint" refers to something that limits or restricts someone or something. It can be a physical limitation or a limitation imposed by rules or regulations. For example, a lack of resources can be a constraint on a project's success, or a legal constraint can limit a person's actions.

"Restrict" refers to the act of limiting or controlling something or someone. It is an action taken to impose a limitation. For example, a company may restrict access to certain websites on its employees' computers, or a diet may restrict the intake of certain types of food.

So, while both words imply limitations, "constraint" is more of a noun that describes a limiting factor, while "restrict" is more of a verb that describes the action taken to limit or control something.
