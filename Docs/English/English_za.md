gpt-4:
    "Playing back" generally refers to the process of reproducing a previously recorded audio or video material. 
    This term is commonly used in the context of media players, music, movies, and other types of recorded content. 
    When you play back a recording, you are essentially listening to or watching the content that was captured earlier. 
    For example, when you listen to a song on your music player or watch a video on your computer, you are playing back the recorded material.

就是 "回放" 的意思, 因为播放的这些信息是早前录制的;
中文里还是叫 "播放" 比较没有歧义...
