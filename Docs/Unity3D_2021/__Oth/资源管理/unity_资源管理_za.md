#     何时使用 ab包  (AssetBundle)
# ------------------------------ #

# from new bing:
    AssetBundles in Unity can be useful for various purposes such as:
    - Downloadable content (DLC)
    - Reducing initial install size
    - Loading assets optimized for the end-user’s platform
    - Reducing runtime memory pressure ³.

    For instance, if you have a game with a large number of assets, you can use `AssetBundles` to load only the assets that are required for a particular level or scene. 
    This can help reduce the initial download size of your game and improve performance by reducing memory usage ³.

    Another use case is when you want to provide additional content to your users after the initial release of your game. 
    You can create `AssetBundles` containing new levels, characters, or other content and make them available for download ³.
